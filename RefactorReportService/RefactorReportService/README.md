## Service Issues
The service currently experiences several issues that need to be addressed:

### Error Occurrences
The service occasionally encounters errors that need to be resolved. These errors can disrupt the user experience and prevent the service from functioning as intended.

### Slow Performance
The service's performance is suboptimal, resulting in slow response times. This can frustrate users and hinder their ability to access and use the service efficiently.

### Incomplete Employee Data
Not all employees are included in the report generated by the service. This results in incomplete and inaccurate data, which can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions based on the report.

### Lack of Total Row
The report generated by the service lacks a total row, which is essential for providing an overview of the data and summarizing the information for users.
