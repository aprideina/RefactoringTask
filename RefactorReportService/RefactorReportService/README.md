# RefactoringTask

## Overview

This is a test project created for demonstration purposes.	

This project contains an initial state of a report service that retrieves information about salaries for a specific month for every employee, divided by department.

## Report example

```
January 2023

Department 1

Name1 Surname1	Amount 
Name2 Surname2	Amount 

Total Amount

Department 2

Name3 Surname3	Amount 
Name4 Surname4	Amount 

Total Amount
```

## Service Issues
The service currently experiences several issues that need to be addressed:

### Error Occurrences
The service occasionally encounters errors that need to be resolved. These errors can disrupt the user experience and prevent the service from functioning as intended.

### Slow Performance
The service's performance is suboptimal, resulting in slow response times. This can frustrate users and hinder their ability to access and use the service efficiently.

### Incomplete Employee Data
Not all employees are included in the report generated by the service. This results in incomplete and inaccurate data, which can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions based on the report.

### Lack of Total Row
The report generated by the service lacks a total row, which is essential for providing an overview of the data and summarizing the information for users.

## Database model

The database structure was constructed based on domain model classes, which were originally located in the initial project.

In the 'DatabaseInitialization' directory, you can find several SQL scripts used for initializing the database.

Note: The naming conventions and table structure have been maintained from the original task, which was provided as a test assignment for an interview.
